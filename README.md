# F1C2-complete

### Description:
A website designed to show case a photography website.

### Technologies and credits:
I fixed very broken html and css.  Here is the orignal that I started from (https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/capstone_fotomatic_start.zip).  Here is the final solution to what codeacademy provided. (https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/skill-paths/learn-how-to-build-websites/F1C1_solution_2019.zip) I if you look at the header, I actually achieved more to what the spec sheet wanted then what this solution came up with.

### Challenges:
This was by far a challengeing project for me.  I thought I knew html/css, but when it comes to fixing a bunch of broken code, it was hard to figure out what was causeing what problem at any specific time.  I couldn't start over because the scenerio was that a team had worked on this, so I can't just come in and start everything over.  So I came up with a hybrid.  I commented out every single line and added it back one by one so I could isolate problems and still use everyone else's hard work to add back in their code when everything seemed all right.  I learned I need to take matters into my own hands too.  If the UI specs seem a little off, then make the best judgement to make it look good but similar to what they want, and still keep things responsive.  If this was a real project I would go back and make sure everything is absoultely perfect.  An easy bells and whisltes thing I would check is to make sure all px are converted to rems.  I'd also double check all the minor spacing specs to the orignal spec sheet.  I did get most if not all of them though.

I just learned about bootstrap 2 days ago.  I think this project would be a lot easier using bootstrap and using their grid layout. But I'm glad I was able to do this the hard way.  I learned a lot!
